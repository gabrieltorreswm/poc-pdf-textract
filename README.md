# Building an OCR solution for document analysis with AWS Textract and AWS StepFunctions.

In this post, I’ll talk about AWS Textract and AWS Step Functions and how they could combine to build remarkable solutions like a serverless OCR (Optical character recognition) processor, useful for Table extraction, like Bank Extract, Invoices or SpreadSheets for instance. But you can add to this as much “sugar” as you want to process any other type of files with different structures.
